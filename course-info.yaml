summary: Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people
  played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game
  and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code
  Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited
  number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with
  the guessing!<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/69</a>
